# python-password-checker
Use the command line to check if a password has been hacked: 

Simply download the file and run the command line prompt in the correct directory where the .py file is followed by your password arguments

Example

run: python checkmypass.py hello good ddddssdfghgfddfghj 

It will return something like: 

hello was found 261368 times... you should probably change your password!        
good was found 38458 times... you should probably change your password!
ddddssdfghgfddfghj was NOT found. Carry on Centurion!
done!
